<h3>
Address Delivered at the Dedication of the Cemetery at Gettysburg <br>
Abraham Lincoln <br>
November 19, 1863 <br>
</h3>
</center>

<p>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth 
on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
</p>

<p>
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated, can
long endure.  We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final
resting place for those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live.  It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this.
</p>

<p>
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not
consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground.  The brave men,
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far
above our poor power to add or detract.  The world will little
note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never
forget what they did here.  It is for us the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced.  It is rather for us to
be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that
cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion --
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have
died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the
people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
